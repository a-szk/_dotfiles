# dotfiles

## usage
Git clone and put the `_dotfiles` directory to `$HOME`, that is to say, `~/_dotfiles`

After that, call the following:
```
./setup.bash
```

Any additional customizations you prefer, please write your own.

## note
The script `./setup.bash` can be called any number of times, 
and backup files are saved automatically to `_dotfiles/backup/`
